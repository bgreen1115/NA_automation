New repository to play with network automation tools for the Building Network Automation Solutions course.
I have a dedicated server running Vmware ESXi 6 where I have installed an Ansible control VM (on Linux Mint), 2 Juniper vSRX firewalls, and 2 Cisco CSR1000v routers.  Ansible is able to access the 2 Juniper boxes via SSH/Netconf and the 2 Cisco boxes via SSH.  

A simple network drawing was created on the Ansible server using LibreOffice and uploaded to the repository.
